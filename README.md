## Why should you use this repository?

This template was written specifically with the following kinds of users in mind:

- people working on their first (or an early) bioinformatics or computational biology project
- anyone who would like some guidance setting up a computational project structure in line with good practice to keep files, code and data in order

If you are already very familiar with building your own project repositories with `git` and GitHub, or you have experience with good practice in this kind of project structure, this template may not be of as much use to you. But it might save some time if it aligns well with your preferred way of working.
