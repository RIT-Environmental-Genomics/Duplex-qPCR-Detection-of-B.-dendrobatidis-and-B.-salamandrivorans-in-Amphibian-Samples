# Duplex-qPCR-Detection-of-B.-dendrobatidis-and-B.-salamandrivorans-in-Amphibian-Samples
<!-- TOC -->
## Description 

The fungal pathogens B. dendrobatidis and B. salamandrivorans are responsible for chytridiomycosis which causes skin lesions and skin ulcers. This is disease that has led to severe declines and extinctions in amphibian populations worldwide. B. dendrobatidis infects the skin of a large range of anurans, urodeles and caecilians, whereas to date the host range of B. salamandrivorans seems limited to urodeles.  B. dendrobatidis has been identified across multiple continents, while B. salamandrivorans is a more recent emerging threat, primarily affecting salamanders in Europe and North America. The ability of these pathogens to spread rapidly through water and direct contact raises concerns for both wild and captive salamander populations. Previous research has demonstrated that environmental factors such as temperature and humidity influence the persistence and virulence of these fungi, but there is still a significant gap in understanding their demographic impacts on salamanders at different life stages.

## Why should you use this repository?

This template was written specifically with the following kinds of users in mind:

- people working on or interested in decetion of B. dendrobatidis and B. salamandrivorans in salamanders, especially comparing infection loads in respect to age.
- nancent enviornemental genomicist interested in learning practical biotechnology techniques

## How to use this repository

This repository is a _template_. It does not contain any project information itself, but it does lay out a directory structure with a minimal skeleton of explanatory `README.md` files explaining the motivation behind each directory in the project structure.

These files can - and should - be modified for your own project. For example, **this `README.md` file is a landing page for the project, explaining what it is, why it exists, and how to use it.** Your project repository should replace this `README.md` file with information that performs the same task _for your project_.

The same applies to `README.md` files in the subdirectories under this _project root_ folder
