<!-- TOC -->
## Description 

The fungal pathogens B. dendrobatidis and B. salamandrivorans are responsible for chytridiomycosis which causes skin lesions and skin ulcers. This is disease that has led to severe declines and extinctions in amphibian populations worldwide. B. dendrobatidis infects the skin of a large range of anurans, urodeles and caecilians, whereas to date the host range of B. salamandrivorans seems limited to urodeles.  B. dendrobatidis has been identified across multiple continents, while B. salamandrivorans is a more recent emerging threat, primarily affecting salamanders in Europe and North America. The ability of these pathogens to spread rapidly through water and direct contact raises concerns for both wild and captive salamander populations. Previous research has demonstrated that environmental factors such as temperature and humidity influence the persistence and virulence of these fungi, but there is still a significant gap in understanding their demographic impacts on salamanders at different life stages.

- this application shares methods and results of duplex qPCR deteciton of fungal pathogens in salamanders.
- the technologies used were Applied Biosystems optical PCR plate & optical film, QuantStudio 3 real-time PCR system, and excel (for analysis)
- the challenges faced were
   - initally there were 6 standards, down sized to 5 as there was not enough space in the 96 well plate
   - B sal appeared to be detected in samples due to excess background noise
   - the real-time PCR system was not able to be set to correct flurophore (an adjacent one was chosen but still lead to excessive background noise)

## Why should you use this repository?

This template was written specifically with the following kinds of users in mind:

- people working on or interested in decetion of B. dendrobatidis and B. salamandrivorans in salamanders
- users interested in pathogen dynamics in diffent amphibian host species, populations, and ages.
- nancent enviornemental genomicist interested in learning practical biotechnology techniques

## How to use this repository

- [2025-04-08_175018 HMS.eds](https://github.com/RIT-Environmental-Genomics/Duplex-qPCR-Detection-of-B.-dendrobatidis-and-B.-salamandrivorans-in-Amphibian-Samples/blob/main/2025-04-08_175018%20HMS.eds) this is a template used for setting up and running the detection experiment in Thermo Fisher Scientific's QuantStudio software. It also gives access to our data, so the user can re-run the experiment using different instructions such as detecting for different florescent probes. 
- [Figures of Results 2.xlsx](https://github.com/RIT-Environmental-Genomics/Duplex-qPCR-Detection-of-B.-dendrobatidis-and-B.-salamandrivorans-in-Amphibian-Samples/blob/main/Figures%20of%20Results%202.xlsx) this is a google sheet with raw data and figures comparing average adult vs. metamorph positive infection load scores and percentages of host species of adults with positive infection load scores. 
- [Raw Reads.xls](https://github.com/RIT-Environmental-Genomics/Duplex-qPCR-Detection-of-B.-dendrobatidis-and-B.-salamandrivorans-in-Amphibian-Samples/blob/main/Raw%20Reads.xls) this is our raw extrapolated data from QuantStudio.
